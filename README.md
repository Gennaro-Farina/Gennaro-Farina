<b>Description:</b>

<p>
 On this Github you will find only a few projects publicly accessible. Other projects are in private repositories, my intention is to work on them a bit and step by step  make them public.<br>

<b> Personal project </b> <i>- the reason I'm using github for personal projects as well:</i><br>
 During my undergraduate years, I never seriously considered version control tools, even having explored them. I saw them as a useless waste of time, being the only contributor. Now I find myself with folders that although organized contain dozens of versions of my software projects, finding the latest version is proving to be an NP-Complete problem. This is why just before entering the professional world I started using version control systems.

<b> Collaborations </b>

  I'm open to collaborations. Better if on computer vision/AI, especially the ones concerning healt-care, automotive and other cool areas.
